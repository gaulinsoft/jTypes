// ########## 2.2.2 ##########

* Fixed: Not-nullable operator properly handles default values
	- Applies to uninitialized fields and automatically implemented properties
* Fixed: Type constraint handlers are shared between classes
	- Previous version only shared handlers between definitions in the same class
* Fixed: Removed global prototype reference leak when building structs
	- Struct optimization introduced this issue in the previous version

// ########## 2.2.1 ##########

* Fixed: Compiler ignores class definitions with an `undefined` value
* Fixed: `::` namespace qualifier supports aliases
	- Only the `global::` qualifier was available in the previous version
* Fixed: Restricted the `global` alias from being defined
* Added: Built-in type constraints `element` and `jquery`
	- jQuery must be included before jTypes to support the `jquery` constraint
	- Browser DOM elements must be an `instanceof HTMLElement` to support the `element` constraint
* Added: Structs now support the `optimized` modifier
* Fixed: `jT_FunctionLock`, `jT_Legacy`, and `jT_PrototypeLock` globals have restrictive defaults
	- Previous version did not fallback to default values when settings were not primitive booleans
